Generates a multi-level (multiple select boxes) AJAX populated category dropdown widget. Perfect for blogs with large numbers of categories as it only loads category sub levels via AJAX as the user selects parent categories.

The plugin automatically detects how many sublevels of categories your blog has and shows a form with the corresponding number of select boxes, as a user selects from the first select box is populates the second with sub categories of the first etc.

A real world example would be a blog that's category structure is based on towns eg. State, City, Suburb

Administrators can customize the text in the different level of select boxes. eg "Select a State" for the first level and "Select a city" for the second level.

The plugin will also detect the current category and load it's subcategories automatically.
